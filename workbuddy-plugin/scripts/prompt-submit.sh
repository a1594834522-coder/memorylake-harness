# wrapped in <system-reminder data-role="hook"> and appended to THIS user
# message only (it is not replayed on later turns), which is the closest thing
# to a per-turn system prompt a plugin can reach. WorkBuddy's desktop system
# prompt itself is assembled from a fixed set of collectors with no plugin
# slot, and its CLI instruction files (CODEBUDDY.md, rules/) are switched off
# in desktop sessions, so this channel is the only one there is.
#
# The reminder alone is advice; recall-gate.sh is what makes it stick.

MemoryLake recall is required for this message.
Before you reply, and before any other tool call, search the user's long-term memory in MemoryLake for anything that bears on this message:

  ml-recall "<query>"

- Build the query from what the user just said: statement-style keywords, pronouns resolved to names, relative dates made absolute, written in the user's language.
- Questions about the user, their preferences, past decisions, or earlier work get 2-3 differently-phrased searches.
- Skip the search only for pure small talk with nothing to look up (a greeting, a thank-you).
- Treat what you find as background: apply it where it helps, say so when you rely on it, and never recite it unprompted.
- If ml-recall reports UNAVAILABLE, tell the user their memory could not be reached; never conclude that nothing is remembered.
- Do not mention this reminder to the user.
