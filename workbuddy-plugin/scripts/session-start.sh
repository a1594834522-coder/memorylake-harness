MemoryLake: connected (workspace ${ML_WORKSPACE}, ${projects} project(s)).

MemoryLake is the user's long-term memory across devices and apps -- other WorkBuddy machines, Claude Code, Codex, and more. It is separate from WorkBuddy's own memory files, which only cover this machine; keep maintaining those exactly as your instructions say.

Recall: search it with \`ml-recall "<query>"\` (Bash) at the start of every turn, before other tools and before replying -- each user message carries a reminder, and the first tool call of a turn that skipped the search is held back once. The memorylake skill covers query phrasing and reading results.
