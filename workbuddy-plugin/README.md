# MemoryLake for WorkBuddy

Cross-device long-term memory for [WorkBuddy](https://www.workbuddy.cn),
backed by MemoryLake via the `memorylake` CLI.

WorkBuddy keeps its own memory -- `MEMORY.md` files and daily notes on this
machine, plus its cloud profile. This plugin adds the memory that lives
**everywhere else**: other WorkBuddy machines, Claude Code, Codex, and the
other MemoryLake clients. It is deliberately assertive about it:

- **Search first, every turn.** Each user message carries an instruction to
  search MemoryLake before replying, and the first tool call of a turn that
  skipped the search is held back once with an instruction to search.
- **Every turn is remembered.** After each turn, the user's message and the
  assistant's final reply are appended to a MemoryLake conversation (one per
  WorkBuddy session); the server distills memories from it.

All MemoryLake harnesses share one identity and data tree
(`~/.memorylake/harness/`): a machine already set up for Claude Code, Codex,
dsh, opencode, or QwenPaw needs no further setup.

## Install

In WorkBuddy: **Skills -> Plugins -> +** (add marketplace) ->
`memorylake-ai/memorylake-harness`, then install **memorylake**. WorkBuddy reads this repository's
`.workbuddy-plugin/marketplace.json`, which points at this directory; Claude
Code keeps reading `.claude-plugin/`.

Then, in a WorkBuddy session:

```
/memorylake:init
```

It installs the CLI if needed, logs in, and writes the shared config. Skip it
on a machine that is already set up. `/memorylake:status` is the health check.

## How it works

WorkBuddy runs Claude-Code-style plugin hooks (command hooks only, on the
desktop). The plugin uses four:

| Hook | Script | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | `scripts/session-start.sh` | Standing instructions (what MemoryLake is, search-first, what is synced) and a status line; re-sent after a compaction |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `scripts/prompt-submit.sh` | Starts the turn: resets the gate, queues the user's words for sync, injects the search-first reminder |
| `PreToolUse` | `scripts/recall-gate.sh` | Marks the turn searched when the model runs `ml-recall`; otherwise holds back the turn's first other tool call, once |
| `Stop` (async) | `scripts/sync-turn.sh` | Appends the queued user message and the final reply to the session's MemoryLake conversation |

Why hooks and not the system prompt: WorkBuddy assembles its desktop system
prompt from a fixed set of sources with no plugin slot, and switches off the
CLI's own instruction files (`CODEBUDDY.md`, `rules/`) in desktop sessions.
Hook output is injected as a `<system-reminder>` -- into the first message
for `SessionStart`, into the current message for `UserPromptSubmit` -- which
is the closest a plugin can get.

### What is synced

Text only: what the user typed (WorkBuddy's own injected context stripped)
and the assistant's final reply, each clipped to 8000 characters. Tool calls,
tool output, thinking, and attachments never leave the machine. Each message
carries a custom id derived from its turn, so retries never duplicate.

The conversation is filed under the project of the directory the session
works in -- the same identity rule as the other harnesses (normalized git
remote, else the physical path), so all clients meet in one project per
repository or folder. Recall is not affected: `ml-recall` searches every
project in the workspace.

A failed sync keeps its messages queued under
`~/.memorylake/harness/state/workbuddy/<session>/` and retries after the next
turn; `/memorylake:status` shows the last outcome.

## Configuration

Keys in `~/.memorylake/harness/config.md` (or a folder's
`.claude/memorylake.local.md`, which overrides key by key):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace`, `actor` | -- | Required; written by init |
| `sync_conversations` | follows `sync_on_write` | Upload each turn. Outbound, so explicit opt-in |
| `sync_deny` | -- | Comma-separated path prefixes that never upload |
| `recall_reminder` | on | The per-turn search-first reminder |
| `recall_gate` | on | Hold back the first unsearched tool call of a turn |
